  - (Mis)spellings are kept intact.
  - Messages longer than 2,000 characters are removed.
  - Long non-Thai messages are removed. Duplicated message (exact match) are removed. **-- Keep this in mind if you're going to use this corpus statistically, as it does not quantitatively represent anything in the language register.**


## File structure

The files are stored in `wisesight-sentiment.zip` in the same format as in the competition [WISESIGHT Sentiment Analysis](http://bit.ly/cu-2019-nlp):

* `train.txt` - The training data. Each line is a piece of text.
* `train_label.txt` - The label of the training data. Each line is the label corresponding to the same line in train.txt.
* `test.txt` - The test data. Each line is a piece of text.

Other details include:
* All files are UTF-8 encoded plaintext
* One message per line
* For a message with multiple lines, a newline character will be replaced with a space - so it will come one line
* Messages with positive sentiment value (~4,500 messages)
* Messages with neutral sentiment value (~16,000)
* Messages with negative sentiment value (~6,600)
* Messages with questions (~500)
* A small portion (~200) of the messages have multiple labels (duplicate entries).

## Sentiment value annotation

- Sentiment values are assigned by human annotators.
- A human annotator put his/her best effort to assign just one label, out of three, to a message.
- A message can be ambiguous. When possible, the judgement will be based solely on the text itself.
  - In some situation, like when the context is missing, the annotator may have to rely on his/her own world knowledge and just guess.
  - In some cases, the human annotator may have an access to the message's context, like an image. These additional information are not included as part of this corpus.
- Agreement, enjoyment, and satisfaction are positive. Disagreement, sadness, and disappointment are negative.
- Showing interest in a topic or in a product is counted as positive.
  - In this sense, a question about a particular product could has a positive sentiment value, if it shows the interest in the product.
- Saying that other product or service is better is counted as negative.
- General information or news title tend to be counted as neutral.

## Classification Benchmark

pyThaiNLP uses this dataset as part of its [text classification benchmark](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/classification-benchmarks). We use the same performance metric as [WISESIGHT Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/wisesight-sentiment/) competition which is **accuracy**.

**Disclaimer** Note that the labels are obtained manually and are prone to errors so if you are planning to apply the models in the benchmark for real-world applications, be sure to benchmark it with **your own dataset**.
